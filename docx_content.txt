OBJECTIVE 

I am a graduating student pursuing a Diploma in Real Estate Business at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, with a strong foundation in valuation, property management, real estate law, and financial analysis. Through both coursework and leadership roles, I have developed the ability to analyze property-related information, coordinate stakeholders, and communicate clearly in fast-paced environments.
